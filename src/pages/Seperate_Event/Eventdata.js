      participants to basic concepts of Power
      electronics such as standard waveforms,
      semiconductor switches, rectifiers, Converters,
      Inverters and safety devices. With the current
      standards of Quality and assurance in Industries,
      rigorous testing is a must for the development of
      high power devices. This is achieved with running
      repeated Simulations of the model, perfecting it
      at every stage. In the event the participants will
      learn to develop and optimize their models for
      particular task helping them to tackle the
      problems of Industries in future.`

      basic of Boolean algebra, Logic gates and Logic
      minimisation followed by Combinational and
      Sequential circuits. Apart from this we focus on
      developing skills for SoC(system on chip)
      designing, simulating these circuits and
      implementing them on FPGA using Verilog HDL.
      Using these concepts of Digital Design along
      with the hands on experience with hardware
      young minds will inspire to solve real world
      problems using Digital Technology.`

      principles and the construction of RLC
      circuits, analog filters, amplifiers,
      converters, astable multivibrators and
      much more, along with applicative uses

      eventInfo : `Prastuti started as an All India Paper Presentation Event. Continuing its legacy we presents its workshop on Paper and Poster Presentation.Paper and poster presentation are the few skills which every engineer must have irrespective of the future field they are into. Paper and poster presentation convey to the world the work you have done and the contributions to a particular field. It is very important to inculcate such skills at a very young age as they take time to master.
      The workshop would give an introduction about different sections of paper and poster, the content to be written in each section.   
      This year Paper and Poster Presentation events won't be judged merely on the research, instead, they will be judged on the presentation skills. Students can present papers and posters on any project they have done in the fields of Electrical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Robotics and any other which includes electrical or electronics.
      Hope to see you in large numbers and use this golden opportunity to inculcate the skills.`
